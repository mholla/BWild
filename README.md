# BWild (Biomechanics in the Wild)
This is the project description for the course project for my AME 50572: Introduction to Biomechanics course, "Biomechanics in the Wild".
Student blog posts can be found on our [course website](https://sites.nd.edu/biomechanics-in-the-wild).

For other educators: please feel free to use it in any way that might be helpful to you!  I only ask that you let me know so I have some idea of if/how it is spreading.  It should be easily adaptable to other topics as well.
